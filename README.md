This is my solution to Dynamic's challenge. It uses XState to model the game's logic and React to render the UI.

Mathler includes some extra features that this solution does not include (at the moment):

- Color blind mode
- Color mode switch (light, dark)
- Difficulty switch (easy, medium, hard, killer)
- Statistics (play count, winrate, current streak, best streak, guess distribution, share results)
- Game state persistence (localStorage)
